# Sentence-Similarity-Calculator
The Sentence Similarity Calculator is a tool designed to measure semantic similarity between sentences, providing valuable insights into how closely sentences convey similar meanings. It utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to convert sentences into vector embeddings, which are then compared using multiple similarity metrics. 
This method allows the calculator to capture both the lexical and contextual meanings of sentences, making it useful in fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). By analyzing similarity, this tool helps bridge the gap between literal and contextual meanings, making it a powerful resource for text analysis.
